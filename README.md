# Persian Audio Transcription & Article Polishing Pipeline

A two-stage pipeline that transforms Persian (Farsi) lecture audio into
print-ready HTML articles — powered by faster-whisper for speech recognition
and the `transcript-polisher` skill for editorial cleanup and layout.

## Features

- **Accurate Persian STT** — OpenAI Whisper `large-v3` via faster-whisper,
  with optional CUDA acceleration
- **Voice Activity Detection** — automatic filtering of silence and non-speech
  segments for cleaner transcripts
- **Intelligent normalization** — systematic correction of garbled ASR output
  (homophone errors, filler words, audio artifacts)
- **Print-ready HTML output** — RTL layout with Vazirmatn typography,
  warm-paper palette, gold accents, and A4-optimized print styles
- **End-to-end workflow** — from raw audio to publishable article in two
  commands with full provenance tracking

## Usage

### Step 1 — Transcribe

Run the transcription engine on an audio file, piping stdout to a text file:

```bash
python transcribe.py voices/session-name.m4a > results/session-name.txt
```

#### Options

| Flag            | Default     | Description                            |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| `--model`       | `large-v3`  | Whisper model size                     |
| `--device`      | `auto`      | Compute device: `auto`, `cpu`, `cuda`  |
| `--language`    | `fa`        | Language code                          |
| `-v` / `--verbose` | off     | Per-segment details to stderr          |
| `--no-vad`      | off         | Disable voice activity detection       |

Output is written to stdout; progress and diagnostics go to stderr.

#### Example

```bash
python transcribe.py voices/jalase-11.m4a > results/jalase-11.txt

# Terminal shows:
# Phase 1/5: Probing audio duration...
# Phase 2/5: Detecting device...
# Phase 3/5: Loading model large-v3 on cuda...
# Phase 4/5: Running transcription...
# Phase 5/5: Decoding segments...
# Done. 142 segments, 12456 total chars.
```

### Step 2 — Polish

Load the **`transcript-polisher`** skill (bundled at
`.agents/transcript-polisher/SKILL.md`) and apply it to the raw text file.
The skill follows a 5-step workflow:

1. **Read & catalog** — identify garbled words and audio artifacts against
   the skill's Persian ASR error reference table
2. **Normalize** — correct all garbled words, strip artifacts and filler,
   convert spoken numbers to Persian digits. All substantive content is
   preserved.
3. **Structure** — organize the lecture into logical sections with headings
   (introduction, background, details, closing remarks)
4. **Build HTML** — generate a self-contained file at
   `results/session-name.html` with:
   - RTL direction, Vazirmatn font (Google Fonts)
   - Warm-paper palette (`#fafaf7` / `#fffdfa`), gold accents (`#c9a96e`)
   - `line-height: 2`, 750px max-width, centered
   - `.legal-quote` and `.highlight-box` styled components
   - Print-optimized: A4 margins, page-break rules, media query overrides
5. **Verify** — confirm all facts are preserved, no artifacts remain, HTML
   is valid and print-ready

## Output

The final HTML article is a single self-contained file you can:

- Open in any browser
- Print to PDF via Ctrl+P (A4, clean margins)
- Share as a standalone document
- Archive alongside the source audio

## Naming Convention

```
voices/session-name.m4a  →  results/session-name.txt  →  results/session-name.html
```

The session name must be identical across all three stages — no dropped or
added hyphens or underscores. This ensures full traceability from source
audio to polished article.

## Workflow Example

```bash
# Step 1: Transcribe a lecture
python transcribe.py voices/jalase-11.m4a > results/jalase-11.txt

# Step 2: Invoke the transcript-polisher skill on results/jalase-11.txt
#         Output is saved to results/jalase-11.html
```

After both steps, the project looks like:

```
voices/
├── .gitkeep
└── jalase-11.m4a
results/
├── jalase-11.txt
└── jalase-11.html
```

## Tips

- **Large models** — `large-v3` downloads ~3 GB on first run. Ensure a
  stable internet connection.
- **GPU memory** — `large-v3` with `float16` on CUDA requires ~3 GB VRAM.
  Fallback to CPU with `--device cpu` on memory-constrained systems.
- **VAD filter** — Keep enabled (default) for edited recordings with pauses.
  Disable with `--no-vad` for continuous speech or music.
- **Long recordings** — The script streams segments incrementally. For
  hour-long lectures, allow 10-30 minutes depending on hardware.

## Included Skills

### transcript-polisher

Bundled at `.agents/transcript-polisher/SKILL.md`. This skill transforms raw
speech-to-text output into print-ready RTL HTML articles. It contains the
complete 5-step normalization workflow, a Persian ASR error reference table,
the HTML design specification, and the quality checklist used during Step 2
of the pipeline. The skill is versioned alongside the project so the
polishing workflow is always in sync with the code.
